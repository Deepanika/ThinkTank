        "question": "2x+2=0",
        "solution": "I'd be happy to help you solve the equation 2x + 2 = 0 step by step. Here's how we can do it:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation**\n\nWe have an equation with one variable, x, and a constant term (+2). Our goal is to isolate x (get rid of the +2) so that we can solve for its value.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract 2 from both sides**\n\nTo get rid of the +2 on the right-hand side, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This keeps the equality balanced and allows us to isolate x.\n\nMathematically, this looks like:\n\n2x + 2 - 2 = 0 - 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x = -2\n\n**Step 3: Divide both sides by 2**\n\nNow that we have 2x on one side of the equation and a constant term (-2) on the other, we can divide both sides by 2. This will help us get x all by itself.\n\nMathematically, this looks like:\n\n(2x) / 2 = -2 / 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = -1\n\n**Step 4: Check Our Solution (Optional)**\n\nTo make sure our solution is correct, we can plug the value of x back into the original equation.\n\nSubstituting x = -1 into the equation gives us:\n\n2(-1) + 2 = ?\n\n= -2 + 2 = 0\n\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side (both are 0), our solution is indeed correct!\n\n**Step 5: Write Our Final Answer**\n\nWe have successfully isolated x and found its value to be -1. Therefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 2 = 0 is x = -1.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps or would you like me to explain anything further?"

        "question": "3x+20+3=0",
        "solution": "I'd be happy to help you solve the equation 3x + 20 + 3 = 0 step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given equation**\n\nThe given equation is: 3x + 20 + 3 = 0\n\nOur goal is to isolate x, which means we need to get rid of all other terms in the equation and find the value of x that makes the equation true.\n\n**Step 2: Combine like terms**\n\nFirst, let's combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n20 + 3 = 23\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n3x + 23 = 0\n\n**Step 3: Subtract 23 from both sides**\n\nNext, we want to get rid of the constant term (+23) by subtracting it from both sides of the equation. This will help us isolate the term with x.\n\n3x + 23 - 23 = 0 - 23\n3x = -23\n\n**Step 4: Divide both sides by 3**\n\nNow, we want to get rid of the coefficient (3) that is multiplied by x. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n\n(3x) / 3 = (-23) / 3\nx = -23/3\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the fraction (optional)**\n\nIf you want to simplify the fraction, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by -1:\n\n(-23) / 3 \u00d7 (-1) / (-1) = 23 / 3\n\nBut since x is often represented as a decimal or fraction, we will leave it in its current form.\n\n**Step 6: Write the final solution**\n\nThe value of x that makes the equation true is -23/3."

        "question": "if i had 15 apples and i ate 2 and gave 3 to my friend, how many apples do i have now",
        "solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the initial number of apples**\nYou start with 15 apples.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the apples you ate**\nYou ate 2 apples, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial amount:\n15 - 2 = 13\n\nThink of it like this: \"If I had 15 apples and I took away 2, how many do I have left?\"\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the apples you gave away**\nYou gave 3 apples to your friend. We need to subtract those from the result of Step 2:\n13 - 3 = 10\n\nThink of it like this: \"If I had 13 apples and I took away 3 more, how many do I have left now?\"\n\n**Answer:** You have 10 apples now.\n\nBy following these steps, we've accurately calculated the number of apples you have after eating some and giving some to your friend."

        "question": "what is meant by carbonization",
        "solution": "I'd be happy to explain what carbonization is and break it down into a step-by-step process.\n\n**What is Carbonization?**\n\nCarbonization is a chemical process that involves heating organic materials, such as wood or coal, in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) to produce a solid, brittle material called charcoal. Charcoal has a high surface area, which makes it useful for various applications, including water filtration, air purification, and industrial uses.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Preparation of Materials**: The first step in the carbonization process is to prepare the organic materials that will be used to produce charcoal. This can include wood chips, coal, or other biomass sources.\n2. **Drying**: The prepared material is dried to remove any excess moisture. This helps prevent steam from escaping during the heating process and ensures a more efficient conversion of the material's energy content into charcoal.\n3. **Heating in a Closed System**: The dried material is then placed in a closed system, such as a kiln or retort, where it can be heated to high temperatures (typically between 500\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C) without exposure to oxygen. This is known as the pyrolysis process.\n4. **Volatile Matter Removal**: As the material heats up, the volatile matter (water and gases) in the material vaporizes and escapes from the system. This process helps remove impurities and water content from the material, leaving behind more carbon-rich material.\n5. **Charcoal Formation**: The heating process causes the remaining carbon molecules to bond together, forming a solid, brittle material called charcoal. Charcoal is highly porous and has a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which makes it useful for various applications.\n6. **Cooling**: After the pyrolysis process is complete, the kiln or retort is allowed to cool slowly. This helps prevent cracking or breaking of the charcoal due to thermal stress.\n7. **Collection and Processing**: The cooled charcoal is then collected and processed to remove any impurities or ash. This can involve crushing, grinding, or sieving the charcoal to achieve a specific particle size.\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Carbonization**\n\nThe carbonization process can be influenced by several key factors, including:\n\n* Temperature: Higher temperatures can produce more reactive sites on the surface of the charcoal, making it more useful for certain applications.\n* Pressure: Increasing pressure can help prevent steam from escaping during the heating process, which can improve charcoal quality.\n* Residence Time: Longer residence times in the kiln or retort can lead to more complete conversion of volatile matter and a higher-quality final product.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand what carbonization is and how it works!"
